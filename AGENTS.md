# AGENTS — Repo Workflow

These instructions apply to all changes in this repository.

## Branch-first workflow (required)

- Always create a new branch before making changes.
- The branch name must reference the Epic/Issue/Feature you are working on.
- You can make one commit or multiple commits as you work.
- Open a PR in Forgejo when the work is ready.
- PRs are reviewed and merged only via the Forgejo UI.
- Do not merge locally.
- Do not open PRs on GitHub.

## Stack learning guide

- `docs/STACK_GUIDE.md` is the simple reference for how the stack fits together.
- If the stack or directory structure changes, update the guide in the same PR.

## Branch naming

Branch names must include the Epic/Issue/Feature ID.

Examples:
- `epic/EPIC-12-landing-page-refresh`
- `issue/ISSUE-104-add-projects-section`
- `feature/FEAT-7-profile-selector`

If you are unsure which ID to use, ask before starting.
