# Contributing

Thanks for contributing. This repo follows a Forgejo-first workflow.

## Source of truth

- Forgejo is the canonical repo.
- GitHub is a read-only mirror for deployment visibility.
- Do not open PRs on GitHub.

## Workflow

- Create a new branch for every change.
- Branch names must reference an Epic/Issue/Feature ID.
- Open a PR in Forgejo for review.
- Merge only through the Forgejo UI.
- Do not merge locally.

See `AGENTS.md` for the authoritative workflow.

## Branch naming examples

- `epic/EPIC-12-landing-page-refresh`
- `issue/ISSUE-104-add-projects-section`
- `feature/FEAT-7-profile-selector`

## Commit notes

- One or multiple commits are both fine.
- Keep commits focused and descriptive.
