# Airbus data internship

## Context

Engineering teams needed fast access to product-structure data to answer
questions about parts, BOMs, and potential change impact. Legacy data existed
but was not easily searchable or visualized.

## My Role

- Built a dashboard to search product structures by serial/manufacturing number
- Developed ETL pipelines to clean and expose legacy datasets
- Delivered a simple web interface for quick queries

## Stack

- Skywise ecosystem
- SQL + Python
- Dashboarding tools

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

- Prioritized fast, queryable tables over complex data models
- Focused on usability for non-technical engineering users

## Outcome & Impact

- Dashboard enabled faster engineering queries
- Cleaned data pipelines improved reliability of analysis

## Learnings

- Data quality work matters as much as dashboards
- Simple query interfaces unlock adoption faster than complex tools

## Media (optional)

- Placeholder for dashboard screenshot
