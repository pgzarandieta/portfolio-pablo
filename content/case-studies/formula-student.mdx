# Formula Student — CAD & configuration coordination

## Context

Formula Student is a student engineering competition with annual rules,
strict documentation, and judged design reviews. The team builds and competes
with a vehicle under real constraints.

## My Role

- Coordinated CAD assemblies and configuration changes
- Supported manufacturing and review workflows
- Participated in design and cost defenses during competitions
- Mentored and onboarded new team members

## Stack

- Parametric CAD + assembly management
- Basic FEA and topology optimization (Altair Inspire)
- Manufacturing: welding, lathe, mill

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

- Structured assemblies with a skeleton methodology for stability
- Balanced lightweight design with manufacturability

## Outcome & Impact

- Improved collaboration and change control in CAD workflows
- Successful technical defenses in competition settings

## Learnings

- Clear configuration control reduces rework under deadlines
- Practical manufacturing constraints shape better designs

## Media (optional)

- Placeholder for car photos or CAD screenshots
