# Home automation + IoT

## Context

I wanted reliable local control and visibility over home devices and energy
usage without relying on cloud-only services.

## My Role

- Deployed Home Assistant with ESPHome integrations
- Integrated a solar inverter for metrics and dashboards
- Planned an ESP32 garage control automation

## Stack

- Home Assistant
- ESPHome + ESP32
- Local networking with secure remote access

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

- Prefer local control and privacy over vendor cloud apps
- Use simple, testable automations before scaling

## Outcome & Impact

- Centralized dashboard for device and energy monitoring
- Clear roadmap for future automations

## Learnings

- Device reliability improves when automations are simple and observable
- Start small, then build on proven integrations

## Media (optional)
