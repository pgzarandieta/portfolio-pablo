# One Platform MVP1 rollout

## Context

Eurodrone is a high‑rigor aerospace program with strict configuration control.
A new internal platform (based on 3DEXPERIENCE) was being rolled out to support
CM and change processes. I worked on the customer side to define requirements
and validate deliveries before go‑live.

## My Role

- Supported the program CM team with change process documentation readiness
- Collected needs from CM users and translated them into clear requirements
- Participated in UAT cycles and reported issues/feedback
- Prepared and delivered training sessions for end users

## Stack

- 3DEXPERIENCE (PLM)
- Jira / Confluence
- CM change process workflows

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

- Prioritized features that unlocked MVP1 adoption over nice‑to‑have tooling
- Focused on simple, repeatable flows to reduce training time and errors

## Outcome & Impact

- MVP1 deployed in production
- ~150 users trained across ~32 sessions
- Supported adoption during the first months after go‑live

## Learnings

- Clear acceptance criteria reduce UAT cycles
- Training success depends on small, realistic exercises
- Aligning CM needs early prevents costly rework later

## Media (optional)
