# Self-hosted platform

## Context

I wanted a reliable, private platform for personal and family services with
single sign‑on, automation, and reproducible deployments. The goal was to make
it easy to add or update services without manual server drift.

## My Role

- Designed the architecture and service boundaries
- Built container stacks with environment files and documentation
- Set up CI workflows and runners for automation
- Managed remote access and security via VPN

## Stack

- Podman + Compose (stack-based deployments)
- Forgejo for repos, issues, and PRs
- Nginx reverse proxy
- Tailscale for secure remote access

## Decisions & Tradeoffs

- Separate stacks per service for safer upgrades and rollbacks
- Prefer simple, documented workflows over complex orchestration
- Keep network details private while still documenting the approach

## Outcome & Impact

- Stable platform for multiple services with consistent deployment patterns
- Faster updates and reduced manual configuration drift

## Learnings

- Good defaults and documentation reduce operational overhead
- Automation is most valuable when it removes repetitive maintenance work

## Media (optional)

- Placeholder for architecture diagram
